## Problem & Idea (3–6 sentences)
VitaLens is for adults who want credible, low-friction guidance on daily vitamins without drowning in conflicting advice. Most people don’t know what to take, how much, or how solubility changes the routine, and generic recommendations don’t build trust. VitaLens asks a short set of questions about age, diet, goals, allergies, and health flags, then generates a personalized plan with clear rationale, timing, and safety notes. The primary action is “Create my plan” → complete the questionnaire → view and save recommendations. People would pay for it because it reduces uncertainty, saves time, and delivers transparent, evidence-informed explanations instead of sales-driven suggestions.
