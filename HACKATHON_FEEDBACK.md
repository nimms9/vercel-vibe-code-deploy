# Hackathon Submission Review & Required Fixes

## Context
This document contains the full reviewer feedback and rubric-based scoring for a hackathon project.  
The landing page was generated using GPT Codex and submitted with partial artifacts.  
This file is intended to be used as **input to Codex GPT CLI** to help generate missing deliverables and fix the submission.

## Overall Reviewer Summary

The reviewer evaluated the submission using the official hackathon rubric.  
Feedback is provided first, followed by category-by-category scores and the final grade.

**Total Score: 27 / 100**

---

## What Was Submitted

### ✅ Included
- Landing page screenshot (high quality)
- Code artifacts:
  - `package.json`
  - `next.config.ts`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `globals.css`
  - `README.md`

### ❌ Missing
- Human-readable Next.js routes file (route architecture)
- Live deployment URL (e.g., Vercel)
- Public GitHub repository link
- Written problem / idea description (submission form content)

---

## Important Clarification About Routes

The submission included `next-env.d.ts`, which references:
.next/dev/types/routes.d.ts

This file is **auto-generated by Next.js** and **cannot be used** to evaluate route architecture.

⚠️ **A human-authored route map is required** (text / markdown / JSON).

## Rubric Feedback (Detailed)

### 1. Landing Page Quality — **24 / 25**

**Strengths**
- Excellent screenshot quality
- Clear value proposition:
  > “Clinically inspired vitamin guidance, personalized in minutes”
- Strong CTAs:
  - “Create my plan”
  - “Try for free”
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Professional, cohesive design
- Looks like a real, production-ready product

**Minor Suggestions**
- Add a small **“How it works”** micro-section
- Include **trust indicators** (e.g., science-backed, clinician-reviewed, testimonials)

---

### 2. Next.js Route Architecture — **1 / 20**

**Reason**
- No human-readable route map was submitted
- Auto-generated Next.js types are not acceptable

**Fix Required**
- Provide a simple route map describing:
  - Public routes
  - Auth routes
  - Protected app routes
  - API route handlers
- Indicate which routes are protected by middleware

---

### 3. Core Functionality — **0 / 25**

**Reason**
- No live deployment URL provided
- Reviewer could not test any flows

**Fix Required**
- Deploy the app (e.g., Vercel)
- Provide:
  - Live URL
  - Test credentials (if auth exists) or magic link flow
  - Any required environment variables

---

### 4. Technical Implementation — **2 / 15**

**Reason**
- Submitted files resemble a base `create-next-app + Tailwind` setup
- No visibility into:
  - `app/` directory
  - App Router usage
  - Server Components
  - Server Actions
  - Route Handlers
  - Middleware

**Fix Required**
- Make GitHub repo public
- Highlight key technical files:
  - `app/`
  - API route handlers
  - Server actions
  - Middleware
- Document technical decisions in README

---

### 5. Problem & Idea Clarity — **0 / 10**

**Reason**
- No written description was included

**Fix Required**
Provide a **3–6 sentence description** answering:
- Who is this for?
- What problem do they have?
- What does the product do?
- What is the primary user action?
- Why would someone pay for it?

---

### 6. Polish & Completeness — **0 / 5**

**Reason**
- Multiple required deliverables missing:
  - Routes file
  - Live URL
  - Repo link
  - Problem description

## Required Fixes for Re-Scoring

### 1. Live Deployment URL
- Deploy app (Vercel preferred)
- Share the URL
- Include:
  - Test credentials OR magic link flow

---

### 2. Public GitHub Repository
Ensure the repo is public and includes:

  - App Router usage
  - Server Actions
  - Route Handlers
- Known limitations

---

### 3. Routes File (Human-Readable)

Create a file such as `routes.md` or `routes.json`.

**Example Format (adapt to actual app):**

```md

## App (Protected via Middleware)
/dashboard — User home  
/profile — Demographics & preferences  
/plan — Personalized vitamin plan (primary feature)  
/history — Past recommendations  
/settings — Account & billing  

## API (Route Handlers)
POST /api/plan/generate — Generate or update vitamin plan  
GET /api/supplements/search — Search supplements
